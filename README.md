This is an Machine Learning project to predict fake news.

## What I Learned
* How to read and clean text data
* Preparing data for prediction by using feature selection
* How to select models used for NLP problems
* How to use hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluating models
* Saving models
* Data Version Control
* How to deploy ML model using Django
* How to productionize model to an online environment, Heroku

There are two branches: main & deployment. Deployment branch is used for deploying the web app to Heroku. Main is used to showcase the work.

If you would like to test the model in production, here's the link: https://fake-news-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/
